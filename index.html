  <h1>Universal Compliance and Management System</h1>
  <p>
    UCAMS is a proprietary governance and compliance framework designed to enforce integrity, authorship, and traceability across digital workflows.
    The platform simplifies complex compliance processes by enabling fully auditable and traceable digital file control.
    UCAMS is applicable in fields such as cybersecurity, intellectual property protection, AI governance, and regulatory assurance.
    The system is currently in an advanced development stage with ongoing enhancements to ensure reliability, scalability, and legal soundness.
    <p>
    <strong>Coming Soon: UCAMS AI Integration</strong><br />
    While the core validator and tester logic is still under development, internal simulations show promising results. These simulations consistently detect faults and enforce structured validation, supporting UCAMS’ potential to serve not only in file compliance, but in future applications such as:<br /><br />
    – Antivirus and firewall engines<br />
    – Secure messaging systems<br />
    – Trust-based AI safety plug-ins<br /><br />
    UCAMS is being designed to operate as a protocol-first safety layer for future intelligent systems—where every action is accountable, and every result is traceable.
